\title{Contains data for genes that are homologous to genes in #ORGANISM#}
\description{

  This package stores annotation data for genes from other
  organisms that have homologous relationships with genes in
  #ORGANISM#. Homologous genes are genes that share an arbitrary
  threshold level of similarity determined by alignment of matching bases

}

\details{

  Data stored in this package are for genes that have homology with
  #ORGANISM#. Homologous genes of other organisms are stored in
  separate packages with names in the format of three-letter organism
  code plus homology. The three-letter organism code consists the first
  letter of the genus name and the first two letters of the species name
  (e. g. hsa for Homo sapiens). 

  Help files for individual data environments contain detailed information
  about the data and the usage.

  The package was built using a downloadable R package - AnnBuilder
  (download and build your own) from www.bioconductor.org using the
  following public data sources:   

  #HGSOURCE# 

  The function #PKGNAME#() provides information about the data files
